# weatherbox

An embedded application built with a Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython,
designed for a compact IoT display device. It connects to Wi-Fi
to periodically synchronize time via NTP and retrieve real-time weather
data, moon phases, and forecasts. The device features a digital display
for showing forecast icons, weather alerts, and the current time, and
uses RGB LEDs to visually alert users of significant weather changes.
