# weatherbox

a Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython-based embedded application designed for a
small IoT display device that shows real-time weather information, moon phases,
and forecasts. It connects to Wi-Fi for periodic NTP time synchronization and
weather updates, visually notifies the user of significant weather changes via
LEDs, and updates a display with forecast icons, weather alerts, and a digital
clock.
